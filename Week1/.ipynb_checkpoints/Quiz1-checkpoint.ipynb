    "* Interprative Language - An interpreted language is a type of programming language for which most of its implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions. \n",
    "* Declarative Language - In computer science, declarative programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.\n",
    "* Operating System Language -An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.\n",
    "* Data Science Language - Umm...\n",
    "* Low Level Language -A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture—commands or functions in the language map closely to processor instructions. Generally this refers to either machine code or assembly language.\n",
